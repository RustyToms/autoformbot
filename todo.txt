------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- put a transparent span handle on top of the add buttons
- put field elements inside a wrapper that doesn't take up any space
- have spaces entered by user escaped
- make all elements in otherForm contenteditable
- Put in an option to just insert code
- scroll form to newly added field
- add selectable and try stacking again

- add Results and notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- Unexpected behavior when contentediting and user generates a space
- textarea prefilled content won't sync with sidebar
- Buttons display weird (they actually appear to display correctly) in ipad browser
- add other form button acts strange when dragged onto form
