  pushed to the background and covered with clear coat
- Allow sorting by column

- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

- make duplicate of field by dragging from edit box

- get rid of all ids in forms, as multiple forms are rendered in the form index
