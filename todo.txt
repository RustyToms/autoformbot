------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- make all elements in otherForm contenteditable
- Put in an option to just insert code
- add selectable and try stacking again
- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add Results and notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- textarea prefilled content won't sync with sidebar
- Buttons display weird (they actually appear to display correctly) in ipad browser
- form_text needs jquery ui stuff properly removed on save
- in form_edit.js, #updateSidebar, exclude checkboxes and radio buttons that
  are not checked from updating the form
