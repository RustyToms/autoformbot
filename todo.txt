------------ To Do -------------------------------------------

- Make background of results be a fixed position version of the form
  pushed to the background and covered with clear coat
- Allow sorting by column

- Choose:

  You host:
    Would you like a webpage or just the form HTML?
      HTML - Provide a box with the form HTML text selected
      Webpage - Either provide the HTML text, or allow the page to be downloaded or emailed

- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

- get rid of all ids in forms, as multiple forms are rendered in the form index
