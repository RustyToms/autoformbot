------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- Allow user to select whether or not they get email results from a form

- seed results header from form not from results
- Have checkbox options each be their own column
- Have header and first column track with scroll
- Make background of results be a fixed position version of the form
  pushed to the background and covered with clear coat

- Allow sorting by column

- add Account stuff, allow a user to change their email address

- Don't log user out when they submit a form

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- Find out why newlines are being added just before </form>

- Find out why the server log shows that the params contain two copies of the
  form text when a form is saved
