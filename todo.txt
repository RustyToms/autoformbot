------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- make each field have options to push to the background or put on top
- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add Results and notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

- make duplicate of field by dragging from edit box

- get rid of all ids in forms, as multiple forms are rendered in the form index

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- Buttons display weird (they actually appear to display correctly) in ipad browser
