------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- seed results header from form not from results
- Have checkbox options each be their own column
- Have header and first column track with scroll
- Make background of results be a fixed position version of the form
  pushed to the background and covered with clear coat
- Allow sorting by column

- Choose:
  We host:
    Provide link, explain options - DONE
  You host:
    Would you like a webpage or just the form HTML?
      HTML - Provide a box with the form HTML text selected
      Webpage - Either provide the HTML text, or allow the page to be downloaded or emailed

- add notifications

- add Account stuff

- Don't log user out when they submit a form

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- If form title is deleted the name of the form is lost and it can't be saved
  (Effectively the form title cannot be deleted from the server, the form will
  always reappear with the form title when the forms index is refreshed)
