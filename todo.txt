------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- add selectable and try stacking again
- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add Results and notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- after creation of new form, while editing title, or after moving submit button the correct sidebar doesn't get loaded
- editing title causees a scrollbar to appear in sidebar
- Buttons display weird (they actually appear to display correctly) in ipad browser
- in form_edit.js, #updateSidebar, exclude checkboxes and radio buttons that
  are not checked from updating the form
-Sometimes when I delete something it tries to send me to the results controller.  ???  - I think the button was sending a request to the server with all defaults?  So now I event.preventDefault() when delete button is clicked.
