------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- MUST LOAD FORM IMAGES AFTER PAGE RENDER IF THEY HAVE MAGIC BOX CONTENT
- redirect to formEdit view on form server save
- Put in an option to just insert code
- add selectable and try stacking again
- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add Results and notifications

- add Code-get

- add Account stuff

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- Ghosts are making things unclickable
- after creation of new form, while editing title, or after moving submit button the correct sidebar doesn't get loaded
- editing title causees a scrollbar to appear in sidebar
- Buttons display weird (they actually appear to display correctly) in ipad browser
- in form_edit.js, #updateSidebar, exclude checkboxes and radio buttons that
  are not checked from updating the form
