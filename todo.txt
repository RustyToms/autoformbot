------------ To Do -------------------------------------------
- seed results header from form not from results
- Have checkbox options each be their own column
- Have header and first column track with scroll
- Make background of results be a fixed position version of the form
  pushed to the background and covered with clear coat
- Allow sorting by column

- Choose:
  We host:
    Provide link, explain options - DONE
  You host:
    Would you like a webpage or just the form HTML?
      HTML - Provide a box with the form HTML text selected
      Webpage - Either provide the HTML text, or allow the page to be downloaded or emailed

- make rails controllers not do more than 1 query for each page

- add notifications

- add Account stuff

- Get rid of user_forms table in db

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- If form title is deleted the name of the form is lost and it can't be saved
- Can get results from any form if logged in to any account.  All forms from form controller should only be found by searching through the account's forms, not all forms.
