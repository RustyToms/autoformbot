------------- Before Push to Heroku --------------------------
Reassign form submit url

RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:clean
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
--------------------------------------------------------------

# set form to return results
# set results to be sent to my server
# provide code for form
#
# report results
# report singular result
#
# add more form fields
# allow fields to be draggable
# allow multiple users to have access to the same account - done
# allow multiple users to work on the same form at the same time

- check out Rangy

# allow margin and padding and background color and border to be changed for each field

Form Submission
- submit with AJAX request?  So that a negative response from server can cause alerts to be made?  Or just make sure the form is good before it is sent - probably


Form Options
- url to redirect to on form submission

------------ Unresolved Issues -------------------------------
- myflash isn't working right
- some fields when added are not immediately contenteditable
- The form checkboxes won't stay disabled when clicked in formEdit
- Radio buttons and some others are not contenteditable on creation and after
  a few keystrokes focus is taken away from them when editing
