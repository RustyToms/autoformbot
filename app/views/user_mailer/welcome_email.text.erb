    Welcome to Form-itable.com! This web app is still under
development, but it is (or should be) fully functional.
Features may come and go and there is also a possibility
that changes may be made to the database that permanently
destroy some or all of your data. But hey, it's free, and
it already has a few really unique and powerful features!

    My name is Rusty Toms, I am making this web app to
practice my web development skills. The app is basically
a single page app based on jQuery and Backbone.js, with a
Rails backend. Once you log in the app has loaded and all
navigation is just views being rendered in your browser,
you aren't actually loading any new pages. AJAX requests
will be sent with small packets of data when forms or
results are saved to the server, created, or deleted.

    This app was created from scratch (well, from an empty
rails app), and all the HTML, CSS, and Backbone files are
completely custom made by myself. Check out the github
repository at https://github.com/RustyToms/form-itable

    If you run into any problems or have feature requests,
or if you think I might be a good addition to your team,
please email me at jonathantoms5@gmail.com.
