FormRadio
# Remove all spaces and non-alphanumeric characters from classes - done
# Remove value field from edit sidebar, have that done manually in the view - done
# Resolve strange bug where the option name doesn't work if the field label is too long - seems to have been resolved when alpha-numeric bug resolved

# make it so formEdit view doesn't refresh when not needed - done for what I needed

- allow margin and padding and background color and border to be changed for each field

# delete form from collection and refresh index page on delete in index page - done by side effect through good refactors


Form Submission
- submit with AJAX request?  So that a negative response from server can cause alerts to be made?  Or just make sure the form is good before it is sent - probably


Form Options
- url to redirect to on form submission
