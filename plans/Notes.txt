General Notes:  Most of the actual pages seem to be for explaining the app, many of which I will not be implementing.

   * indicates tab on webapp template

    - Home Page /

    Duplicate to show off CSS, probably won't include most functionality.  Links that don't go anywhere should turn grey on hover.

    - Login /login (secure.wufoo.com/login/)
    Yup.  Logout is a popup?  After successful login direct to form manager.  After login, the first part of the url is the username.

    - SignUp  (secure.wufoo.com/signup/:accountplanid)

    Signup form that is different depending on plan name.  Defaults to free account (/signup/1)


    ------------------Only Available While Logged In-----------------------

    - Form Builder Page /build/:formname

    "Build" this first.

    - * Form Manager /admin

    This will be the user's home page, build it after login page. Contains links to forms and making a new form.

    - * Account Manager /account

    Low priority.  Shows usage and possible plans, shows user info. Links to User Management, activity log, and delete account.

    - * User Management /users

    Shows users associated with account, selected user info (editable), shows permissions of user, links to creation of new user.

    - Activity Log /logs

    Unlikely to implement.  Shows activity of user.

    - * Theme Designer /themes

    Probably not going to do this.

    - * Reports /reports

    Need to generate a report to see meaningful content on this page. Links to Report Builder.  Implement after completion of form builder functionality.

    - Report Builder /report/builder

    This uses some sort of widgets.

    - * Help

    Basically takes you to a different site with all sorts of help stuff. Opens in a new tab. Probably won't implement
